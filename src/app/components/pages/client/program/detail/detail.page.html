      Nature and rural life programs are designed to protect property collective or
      individual rights, organic food security, natural richness and seeds; it also aims to
      empower traditional rural ladies and their communities through introducing them
      to international commerce platforms, in which they are encouraged to preserve
      their natural resources, agricultural knowledge and landscapes from an
      entrepreneur vision.

      Art and culture address the need of widows of artists; it is a project to rescue art
      patrimony and heritage; specifically, we aim to preserve the memory of those
      artists that served the Nation, but that are left behind for the new waves. It also
      connects young and senior artists to produce new projects designed to spread our
      vision through events carefully based on historiographical methodologies.
